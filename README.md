# Data-Studio-Final-Project
Green Infrastructure and Affordable Housing in New York City

This repository includes all of the code for the "Green Infrastructure and Affordable Housing in New York City" analysis, conducted by Willa Evans. 

**Running the Analysis**

To run this analysis, you will need the csvs for the following data sets: Housing_New_York_Units_by_Building.csv, NYCHA_ACCESSolar_Opportunities.csv, NarrowedGreenInfra_geocoded.csv, GreenRoofData2016_geocoded.csv. All of these should be in the repository but double check. 
Once you have the files, open up R studio and upload them in. 
To make the process cleaner, the code is broken up into 4 tabs- one data set per tab. Start with the Affordable Housing Data tab and then follow the steps to the end of the page. Then click the next R script tab. They are in order and you should not have to go backwards.
